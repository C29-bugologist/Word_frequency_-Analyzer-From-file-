The aroma of freshly baked cookies filled the air, wafting through the house in teasing waves.
The timer on the oven beeped insistently, its repetitive shrill a counterpoint to the chirping of birds outside.
Inside the kitchen, a flurry of activity unfolded. Sarah bustled around, her hands covered in flour, humming the same cheerful tune under her breath over and over.
On the counter, a bowl overflowed with a mountain of chocolate chips, their dark richness a stark contrast to the bright white dough.
A sense of anticipation hung thick in the air, as thick and sweet as the cookie dough itself.
